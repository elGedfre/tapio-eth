 * @title LPToken token wrapper with static balances.
 * @dev It's an ERC4626 standard token that represents the account's share of the total
 * supply of lpToken tokens. WLPToken token's balance only changes on transfers,
 * unlike lpToken that is also changed when staking rewards and swap fee are generated.
 * It's a "power user" token for DeFi protocols which don't
 * support rebasable tokens.
 * The contract is also a trustless wrapper that accepts lpToken tokens and mints
 * wlpToken in return. Then the user unwraps, the contract burns user's wlpToken
 * and sends user locked lpToken in return.
